      Descent 2 is a classic 'tunnel shooter' released for the PC in 1996.  It
      was developed by Parallax Software and published by Interplay.  It, along
      with its predecessor Descent, was one of the first games to offer true
      3-dimensional graphics, 6 degrees of freedom in movement, and the
      capability to join multiplayer games on-the-fly.  DXX-Rebirth is a
      modification of the Descent 2 source that was released by Parallax,
      offering OpenGL graphics, advanced multiplayer, new features, and
      cross-platform compatibility.
