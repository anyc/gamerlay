WAKING MARS is a one-of-a-kind adventure in which you jetpack through
subterranean Mars encountering a host of extraordinary alien lifeforms
that operate as a living, breathing ecosystem. Learn and master the
behaviors of these creatures to create ecosystems of your own design
if you are to survive and discover the secrets of Marsâ€™ past.

In 2097, life is discovered on Mars. When your mission of first contact
becomes trapped by a cave-in, you must master the alien ecosystem to survive.
Soon you stumble upon more than anyone expected, and with time running out,
you will make a decision that determines the fate of a lost planet.
