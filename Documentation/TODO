What we need to do until the project will be ready ?

- Set up ChanServ flags to the channel (auto-op, auto-voice and so on)

- Create a project page (on cvs gentoo module)
  -> scarabeus you'll be the leader

- Announce the project to dev-announce

- Write a page "HowToContribute" will be a good thing ?

- Have a look to games.eclass but normally all should be okay
 (scarab: may be more details about that ?)

- Create an e-mail alias

- We need to register ourselves into the herd ;)

- Set up all stuffs on bugzilla
