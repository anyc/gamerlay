	# "libpng.so". Patch "configure" to specifically require libpng 1.5. While
	# it's usually preferable to patch "configure.in" instead, most SDL
	# autotools-based scripts are fundamentally, nonsensically broken. Calling
	# eautoreconf() here with the following globally defined variables *SHOULD*
	# produce a working "aclocal.m4" file with corresponding scripts:
	#
	#   AM_OPTS='--foreign --include-deps'
    #   AT_M4DIR='acinclude'
	#
	# Naturally, it doesn't, failing with the usual
	# "libtool: version mismatch error". I hate you, autotools. Since SDL itself
	# has since moved to CMake, this really isn't worth fixing. Hack it for now.

	# SDL_image 2.0 ships with a demonstrably horrible "configure" script. By
	# default, this script adds globals to the created "Makefile" resembling:
	#
	#   AUTOCONF = /bin/sh /var/tmp/portage/media-libs/sdl-image-9999/work/SDL_image/missing --run autoconf-1.10
	#
	# On running "make", "Makefile" then attempts to run the expansion of
	# "$(AUTOCONF)". Since the system is unlikely to have autoconf-1.0, the
	# "missing" script naturally fails with non-zero exit status. To sidestep
	# this insanity, force "configure" to instead set globals resembling:
	#
	#   AUTOCONF = true --run autoconf-1.10
	#
	# Since "true" always succeeds with zero exit status, this forces sanity.
	# SDL, I am not happy with you.
